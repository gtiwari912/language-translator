# Language-translator
This is a Python Tkinter GUI Application that can translate text into any language. It can also autodetect the source language of the text and translate it into the language required.

### Installation Setup.
The program uses googletrans==3.1.0a0 for the translation of text. Hence install it by this command given below.
```
pip install googletrans==3.1.0a0
```
I would recommend to do it in virtual environment.
